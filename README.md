# Digit-Recognizer-App

The motivation behind this project was to "Deploy a deep learning model as Web Application".

In this project, an application was deployed on AWS server which lets user to draw a digit/number (handwritten digit) in the front end and with the help of trained Deep learning model (CNN) in the back-end, the number gets recognized by the application correctly.

CNN model was tuned by testing it on the worst possible handwritten digits we could give, model performed exceptionally well on the real handwritten digits.

We will need to generate and download RSA private key(.pem). Along with the above project, you will have to get the private key to try it on your own.

Few results of the AWS deployed Digit Recognizer Application:
